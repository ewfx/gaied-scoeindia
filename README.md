## 🎯 Introduction
This project automates email classification and data extraction using Gen AI LLMs to improve efficiency, accuracy and turnaround time. The manual process of data extraction and classification requires a team of gate keepers , is time consuming and prone to human errors. The main objective of this project is to solve this use case of removing human intervention and automate the whole classification process.

## 💡 Inspiration
What inspired you to create this project? Describe the problem you're solving.

## ⚙️ What It Does
1) Content Extraction from email and attachments
2) Perform OCR
3) Context based data extraction using LLM
4) Detect duplicates by matching the vector embeddings stored in ElasticSearch
5) Classify email using LLM into pre defined request and sub request types
6) Handles multi request email with primary intent identification
7) Priority based extraction where user can define priority rules
